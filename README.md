## Overview

### Project Details

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- View information about me and be able to view a list of my personal projects with links to the live site and source code.
- If interested, there is also a contact form should someone want to reach out to me for questions or for potential clients who are interested in having a site built for their business.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, SCSS, JS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I knew I needed a personal website to showcase my work so after going through multiple versions I finally found a website style that worked for me. After building it I learned how to host my site and validate my contact form via Netlify.

### Continued development

When I revisit this project, I would like to redesign and use a framework like React to build a new one.
